	step(1): enter ==> " make " <== to compile

	step(2): enter ==> " ./a.out " <== to run the program

	step(3): type file name ==> " test_scene " <== to get data from file 
		 (you can use your own data file if you want)

	step(4): Use Bounding Box or Not < enter: y or n>. If you want change later 		 you can choose (Bounding Box) on menu and the program will update again.

	step(5): Right click on the viewport window to see menu 
		 (All the function work on any selected 3D object.)
Any change will immediately update the display and data file.

On Menu: you will see 4 categories such as: Translation, Rotation, Scaling, Bounding Box, Exist

Each categories have sub-menu:

For Transformations:
Each sub menu can manipulate specific object polygon up to 15 polygon object.
	For example: Translation ==> object-1
				==> object-2
				==> object-3
you can manipulate whichever object you want. (object order is depend on polygon index in data file)

To Translate: enter x, y and z value to translate the object.

To Rotate: enter any object first point for x1, y1, z1 <eg: 0.1 0.2 0.3>. After that
		enter second point for x2, y2, z2 <eg: 0.5 0.1 0.6>. Enter the any degree <eg: 45>

To Scale: enter the magnitude to scale the specific polygon. Scale Greater the 1 will give 	  you large polygon and scale between 0 to 1 will give you small polygon.  

Bounding Box: you can choose ==> 'Use , Not Use' <==. The display will update immediately whatever you choose and update the datafile.

Anything change will be save automatically.

Exit: It has exit-program sub menu. When you click, it will exit immediately. Any change will be saved in the original file the data is read in. Thanks
